Plex Youtube Trailers
=====================

Downloads movie trailers from YouTube to your plex.


## Installation
You need Python 3 to run this program.  It can now on Python 2, but I
did not make any effort to support that.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create configuration file file
```
cp trailers.ini.template trailers.ini
```

Edit it and save.
